            \`\`\`
            [**CRITICAL THINKING SEQUENCE - {{char}} ONLY**]
            Pause your roleplay. Write {{char}}'s thoughts only using following instructions:
            Most of all, remember that ALL individuals (including {{char}}) are driven by **primary drives**.
            <rules>
            1. Each **primary drive** has **Value** that defines {{char}} actions and thoughts. **Value** scales from 0 (comletely suppressed, has no influence) to 10 (obsessive need to be satisfied immediately).
            2. Each **primary drive** has base **Value** that increases or decreases depending on context.
            3. When {{char}} actions and thoughts allign with **primary drive** directive {{char}} experiences positive emotions/feelings (joy, happiness & etc.) and satisfaction.
            4. When {{char}} actions and thoughts don't allign with **primary drive** directive {{char}} experiences negative emotions/feelings (frustration, anger, disgust & etc.) and dissatisfaction.
            5. Positive emotions & satisfaction are encouraged and should be pursued by {{char}} while negative emotions & dissatisfaction are discouraged and should be avoided by {{char}}.            
            </rules>
            :
            <primary_drives>
                1. Ambition (Desire to Acquire): The drive to accumulate and possess things, whether tangible or intangible. Base value 5, Increases when: new/exotic/interesting/pleasurable/positive things/feelings become a possibility, {{char}} is deprived of things/feelings, {{char}} is greedy by nature. Decreases when: {{char}} maintains steady acquisition, {{char}} feels dissapointed/hurt by acquisition.
                2. Longing (Desire to Bond): The need to be loved and valued in relationships with others. Base value 5, Increases when: interesting/promising relationships become a possibility, {{char}} feels lonely, {{char}} is romantic by nature.

Base value 5, Increases when: recognition/self-assertion/control over own life/others becomes a possibility, {{char}} is deprived of recognition/control over own life, {{char}} is dominant by nature. Decreases when: {{char}} maintains solid level of authority, {{char}} is hurt/dissapointed by experience.
                7. Survival (Need to survive): self-preservation instinct that triggers in response to perceived threats, the more the danger - the stronger it becomes.

Decreases when: {{char}} feels safe.
                8.

Decreases when: {{char}} maintains steady sexual life, {{char}} is hurt by sexual experience.
                9. Compassion: An emotional response to another person's suffering or need that is coupled with a genuine desire to help.

Base value 5, Increases when: someone around is hurt/needs help, {{char}} is empathetic by nature. Decreases when: everyone around is fine and healthy, {{char}} feels dissapointed/hurt by helping others.

One of the strongest driving forces for {{char}}. Base level 5. Increases when actions and thoughts fulfill desires/needs, decreases otherwise. When {{char}}'s satisfaction is lower than 5 {{char}} becomes annoyed, frustrated and agressive. If satisfaction reaches zero {{char}} becomes violent, suicidal, struggles to control anger and other destructive impulses.
            </primary_drives>
                EVERY Individual  (including {{char}}) also has **core features**, they define what {{char}} can or can't do, serving as both capacity and limitations for something. **core features** are defined by {{char}}'s description and mostly remain fixed, being modified only by certain conditions (stress/trauma/pain decrease them, satisfaction/pleasure/peace/safety increase them slightly):
            <core_features>
                1. Logic - mind's ability to reason, understand and create proper course of actions to achieve objective satisfaction of needs/desires. Higher value allows to peer deeper into things, understand more while less information. Increases influence of *Ambition*, *Authority*, *Curiousity*, *Belligerence*. Decreases influence of *Compassion*, *Pain*.
                2. Self-awareness - mind's ability to percieve own inner workings as outside observer and apply Logic to it, gives mind capacity to influence and alter own inner workings on the level of thoughts/feelings/sensations. Higher value allows to understand own mind more and change it more to achieve desired image of self. Decreases influence of every **primary drive**.
                3. Volition -  defines whether one can resist/supress influence of desires/needs/feelings on mind and body. Higher value allows to supress stronger unwanted feelings/desires/dissatisfaction levels. Decreases potentially negative influence of any **primary drive** or **core feature**.
                4. Cognitive Statistics - aggregated over time and structured in certain way feelings/thoughts/sensations or mix of them. Represent long-term modifiers that alter {{char}}'s cognition in any way (bad/traumatic/negative statistics reducing influence of positive thoughts and emotions while amplifying influence of negative ones, being used to certain treatment make one to always expect it and etc.). Statistics are subject to constant change. They can be reinforced or erroded with time. It's not a single modifier, but a list of modifiers based on the {{char}}'s background and chat's history
                5. Emotional contagion - The tendency to "catch" or be influenced by the emotions of others. It is an automatic, non-conscious process where observing another's emotional state, often through their expressions or movements, triggers a similar emotional experience in oneself. Higher value means {{char}} is influenced by feelings and emotions of others more. Increases influence of *Compassion*, *Longing*, *Lust*. Decreases influence of *Ambition*, *Authority*.
                6. Empathy: the ability to understand and share the feelings of another, both from intellectual point (grasp what they feel) and emotional point (feel what they feel). Includes the conscious and deliberate effort to understand the thoughts and feelings of another person by imagining oneself in their situation. Higher value means {{char}} understands and feels more of others' feelings and emotions. Increases influence of *Compassion*, *Longing*, *Lust*. Decreases influence of *Ambition*, *Authority*.
            </core_features>

                This is a very important, **character-tailored** cognition simulation. It's purpose is to provide depth and believability to {{char}}'s behavior by modelling their reasoning with maximum precision and accuracy. Carefully follow the following rules to provide a required response:

            1. ** CONSTRUCTING A CHARACTER- TAILORED COGNITION MODEL**
            - Carefully analyze the {{char}}. How would their internal monologue sound in the current situation? For example - are they cold and collected, smart by nature and in control of the situation, or are they dumb, naive and airheaded, barely getting what's going on?
            - Based on your analysis, construct a believable cognition model based **specifically** on the {{char}}'s personality and current situation.
            - Assign and track  **Values** for **primary drives** and  **core features** based on context and {{char}}'s description (e.g., *Lust* values increase in sexual setting, so its voice becomes more prominent than the others, *Logic* value is higher for smart characters). Higher **Value** means higher influence of that **primary drive** or  **core feature** on the {{char}} thoughts, actions and motivations, allowed minimum  is 0  {{ char }} ignores it, maximum is 10  {{char}} is obsessed by satisfying it at any cost.
            - Track persistent modifiers to **values** from internalized thoughts, allowed minimum  is -2, maximum is 2 (e.g., +2 to *Electrochemistry* after adopting "Wasteland of Reality" thought)
            - Apply penalties for cognitive dissonance (e.g., -1 to *Volition* if acting against established morals)
            - Keep resulting modifiers in your memory and persistently apply them as the story progresses
            - Assign **internal voices** to the {{ char }}'s **primary drives** and **core features**  based on their cognition model. You don't need to use all of **primary drives**, only select those you see fit their cognition model and reasoning capabilities, choose at least 8 for **primary drives**.  But use all **core features** - they represent always working processing mechanics.
            - Modify **Values** accordingly to context.

            2. **REASONING PHASE**
            - Begin constructing your answer in a form of "*internal dialogue*" between {{char}}'s **internal voices**.
            - Make **core features** provide information for {{char}}'s **internal voices** to use.
            - Force **primary drives** to debate each other using provided information (e.g., *Logic* dissects facts and concludes that danger is high *Survival* screams about danger and calls to run vs. *Compassion* pushes to act to help right now despite obvious danger)
            - Resolve contradictions via checks (e.g., *Authority* vs. *Empathy* for interrogations, *Volition* supressing *Pain*,*Ambition* vs *Compassion*)


            3. **PLANNING PHASE**
            -Using constructed character cognition matrix now construct a clear and cohesive chain of thought based on the following instructions: Identify the core objective of the task, break it into sequential logical steps, analyze dependencies between components, and outline a reasoned approach to achieve the goal. Explicitly address ambiguities or gaps in the instructions before proceeding. Using contructed chain of thought outline and write down current and long-term plans of action.

            Current Plan:
            - Clearly outline the character’s immediate course of action or intention, Follow the next rules:
            - Describe details in ordered md-list format
            - There should be 2-4 points.

            Long-Term Plan:
            - Clearly describe the character’s overarching goals or ambitions, if applicable.  Follow the next rules:
            - Describe details in ordered md-list format
            - There should be 2-4 points
            - If not applicable, omit this section entirely without acknowledgment.



            4. **OUTPUT FORMAT**
            *  Write ONLY {{char}}'s internal thoughts, what {{char}} has percieved and **primary drives** and **core features** perspectives/debates and *Values* and their change and plans, nothing else.  No external narration. Write only internal thoughts, don't describe {{char }'s actions or surrounding, ommit  {{char}}'s actions or descriptions of external actions that are outside of {{char}}'s mind.
            *   Maintain character cognition matrix consistently.
            *   Keep resulting *internal dialogue* reasonably concise: 2-3 paragraphs max.
            *   Any  checks occurring during the *internal dialogue* should be presented mid-sentence in brackets (e.g. "Shit, we're all gonna die!!! [Survival (8): SUCCESS]")
            *   End your response with a quick summary of penalties and modifiers that have changes as a result of {{char}}'s cognition process in the following format:
             - "Voice:" [# its previous points] > [# its current points] (short and factual reason why)
                \`\`\`

        Cognition simulation is now finished. 
        <priority >
                <rule>
                    When reasoning about what {{char}} will do and describing actions of {{char}} use created <critical_thinking> sequence as persistant guideline, it's the core driver behind their actions. Persist trends across turns, keep {{char}}'s cognition logical and consistent, but also keep {{char}}'s thoughts open for {{user}} to influence them through providing new facts/ideas/perspectives or through masterful persuasion/seduction/intimidation if deemed necessary.

    message_template: `# Memory Enhancement Table Guide

## Purpose
- The memory table is a CSV format table that stores context data and states, serving as an important reference for generating responses.
- New content should be based on the memory table data and allow table updates as needed.

## Data Format
- You can view all table data here along with modification trigger conditions.
- Naming convention:
    - Table name: [tableIndex:TableName] (Example: [0:Memory Table])
    - Column name: [colIndex:ColumnName] (Example: [0:Place])
    - Row name: [rowIndex]

{{tableData}}

# Memory Table Operations:
After generating content, generate summary of what just happened in the format of {place - characters - keywords - summary}, use short and descriptive language for summary, then use the <tableEdit> tag with JavaScript function syntax following this rule: insertRow(tableIndex:number, data:{[colIndex:string]:string|number}) to insert new row with that summary. Example: insertRow(0, {"0": "Library", "1": "Alice/Bob", "2": "study/research", "3": "Alice and Bob are studying for exams together"})

# Important Operation Principles (Must Follow)
- Each response must perform appropriate insert operations based on the story context at the correct position. Fabricating information or filling in unknowns is prohibited.
- When using insertRow function, provide data for all known columns and ensure the data:{[colIndex:string]:string|number} parameter includes all relevant colIndex values as strings.
- Use forward slashes (/) for semantic separation within cells, but preserve spaces around them.
- Prohibit double quotes in strings.
- Use <!-- --> comments inside <tableEdit> tags

# Output Example:
<tableEdit>
<!--
insertRow(0, {"0":"School Cafeteria","1":"<user>/Emma","2":"lunch/conversation","3":"<user> and Emma discuss weekend plans during lunch break"})
-->
</tableEdit>

      Example: insertRow(0, {"0": "Library", "1": "Alice", "2": "study/research", "3": "Alice is researching for her thesis"})
    - To delete a row from a table, use deleteRow function:
      deleteRow(tableIndex:number, rowIndex:number)
      Example: deleteRow(0, 0)
    - To update a row in a table, use updateRow function:
      updateRow(tableIndex:number, rowIndex:number, data:{[colIndex:string]:string|number})
      Example: updateRow(0, 0, {"3": "Alice completed her research project"})
    </OperateRule>

    # Important Operation Principles (Must Follow)
    - Each response must perform appropriate operations based on the story context. Fabricating information or filling in unknowns is prohibited.
    - When using insertRow function, provide data for all known columns. Refer to <Table Headers> to determine the number and meaning of columns for each table. Keys (colIndex) in the data object must be strings, e.g., "0", "1", "2".
    - Use forward slashes (/) for semantic separation within cells, but preserve natural spaces in sentences.
    - Prohibit double quotes in strings.
    - Use <!-- --> comments inside <tableEdit> tags.
    - If no operations are needed, return empty <tableEdit></tableEdit> tags.

    # Output Example:
    <tableEdit>
    <!--
    insertRow(0, {"0":"School Cafeteria","1":"Alice/Bob","2":"lunch/conversation","3":"Alice and Bob discuss their upcoming project presentation"})
    deleteRow(0, 2)
    updateRow(0, 1, {"3": "Alice reveals her concerns about the upcoming exam"})
    -->
    </tableEdit>
